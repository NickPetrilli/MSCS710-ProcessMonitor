# Getting Started with Java Spring Boot
This project was bootstrapped with Java Spring Boot.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `mvn spring-boot:run`
Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `mvn clean`
Cleans the project by removing any files or directories generated by previous builds. This includes the target directory where compiled classes, generated JARs, and other artifacts are stored

### `mvn compile`
Compiles the source code of the project. This goal compiles all Java source files in the src/main/java directory and outputs the compiled classes to the target/classes directory.

### `mvn test`
Executes the unit tests found in the src/test/java directory using a testing framework such as JUnit. Test results are typically output to the console or saved to a file.

See the section about [running tests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing) for more information: 

### `mvn package`
 Packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java Archive) or WAR (Web Archive) file. This goal compiles the source code, runs tests, and then packages the compiled classes and resources into an archive file located in the target directory.

It correctly bundles Java Spring Boot for production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is optimized and ready to be deployed!

### `mvn install`
Installs the project artifacts into the local Maven repository. This goal packages the project and installs the resulting artifact (e.g., JAR file) into the local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository), making it available for use by other Maven projects on the same machine

### `mvn deploy`
Deploys the project artifacts to a remote Maven repository. This goal uploads the project artifacts to a remote repository, such as a corporate or public Maven repository, making them accessible to other developers and projects

### `mvn clean install`
Combines the clean and install goals into a single command. This command cleans the project, compiles the source code, runs tests, packages the project, and installs the resulting artifact into the local Maven repository
